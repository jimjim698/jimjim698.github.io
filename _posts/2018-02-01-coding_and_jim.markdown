When I first entered college right after high school I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I took my general education classes and then spent the next couple years jumping from major to major. I was a Psychology major a Criminal Justice major and even got into nursing school for a very short period of time. In my early 20s the reality of the student debt I was accumulating started becoming real and I decided to stop this nonsense dance toward nowhere and take a break from school. A couple years passed and I knew I wanted to finish school but I still did not know where I wanted to commit my focus. In 2015 I met someone who thought like I did in a lot of ways and he suggested I look into coding. He told me it's applied logic.

In the beginning his words did not click. I started looking at code online and trying to make sense of it and it looked anything but logical. At first glance, from an average Joe's perspective, coding looked like complex babble. What was logical about any of this and how was I going to be able to make sense of it? Luckily for me I respected this guy a lot and decided to start Flatiron's prep course.

Once I started going, it quickly made sense. Well I guess it didn't quickly make sense but it quickly became apparent how it would make sense and I stuck to it. Now as I'm moving through the Online Web Developer program I am confirming more and more to myself that the logical nature of writing code compliments the way my brain works very well. While I'm still new in this world I am comfortable that this field was the right choice for me and I am right where I belong.
