Fresh out of high school in Bricktown, New Jersey the plan was to go to college, get a good job and start making a lot of money as soon as possible. The most absurd part of this plan was that I had no idea what I was going to go to school for. I had always done really well in school and I had this idea that if you were good at school, you earned a degree and then you got a good job. Up until this point I had not really considered the details to go along with this plan. While I did enjoy school, the majority of my time outside those walls was spent playing Pop Punk music in various bands with my friends.

So off to college I went. I quickly finished my associate degree in Liberal Arts and was forced to pick a direction. A friend of mine suggested nursing and after seeing the starting salary and timeframe for schooling I was sold! I took my Anatomy and Physiology 1 and 2 in accelerated summer courses to catch up to my friend and within a year I was accepted into Nursing School. It wasn't long after being admitted that I realized my priorities were not straight and that I had worked my tail off to get into school for a profession that I wasn't really interested in and so I dropped out and began taking classes at Kean University.

I spent the next two years making the same the mistake. I would pick an arbitrary major, take a few classes and then start over again. During this time my grades were beginning to suffer as I spent more and more time partying. It wasn't that the classes were getting harder, I just found myself strategically figuring out the bare minimum that was required of me to pass and doing only as much as I needed to. This lifestyle eventually got the better of me and I was forced to seek treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. School was going to have to wait while I got my life back together.

It would be nice to say I was fast learner when it came to recovery but this did not come as easy for me as school had. I went to treatment in Florida and then eventually found myself in Salt Lake City, Utah with almost nothing left. I am happy to say I did finally find a program that works for me and I have now been clean and sober for over two years. 

When I was about a year clean, living in a sober living house, I found myself right back to where I was 2 years earlier, unsure of what degree to pursue when I enrolled back into school. A friend that lived in that house with me, a software engineer, suggested I give coding a try. I connected with this guy and the way he talked about his work was certainly intriguing. He simply loved what he did for a living. He would get excited describing how he could have an idea in his head and then make into a reality by writing code. I decided to give it a try.

I spent a great deal of time researching schools and trying free coding courses online. I eventually came across Flatiron School's Bootcamp Prep Course. It wasn't far into the course that I realized programming had been exactly what I was looking for. I have always been a very logical thinker but at the same time creative. It became apparent that software development was the perfect mix of both of these strengths,

I have now been enrolled in the Online Web Developer Program since late September and I have been thoroughly enjoying every lesson and lab that I have completed. I'm excited to see where the next step of this journey takes me!
