I really had an awesome time building my Sinatra Portfolio Project. Like with the first project, I chose to do something that was meaningful to me.  I have been managing a halfway house for 2 and a half years now and have often thought it would be great to have some kind of software to help me keep track of all my residents and what sanctions they are currently on. Sanctions include things like curfew and service hours. 

This being something I had contemplated before, I already had a lot of ideas on how I wanted this work. So many ideas that it was a bit overwhelming at first. I tend to future trip and get discouraged when I try to figure out how to implement features before I've even gotten my application up and running. One thing that has helped immensely with labs and this project is something Avi often says in video lectures. Basically what he says is to just start coding. Get something working and even if its not the right structure for the final design or won't work with another feature you want to include that's OK because at least your making progress and you can always make necessary changes if problems arise.  This really does work. Once I got going the pieces connected themselves and within a few hours the basic structure I needed was complete.

The most fulfilling part of this process was going through the application once it was running and finding little problems  or bugs and having a pretty good idea of how to fix them. An example of this was the way my content was displaying based on what information was entered. What I mean is, if a user signed up using lower case letters or created a new resident the same way, I wanted the display to look aesthetically pleasing with the first letter of the name being capitalized. Also, I wanted to make sure that not only could a user not have exact duplicate resident names, but also they could not get around this by capitalizing one and lowercasing the other. Once I saw this was an issue it was pretty validating to immediately have at least an idea of how to correct it.

I'm excited to learn more from this project evaluation like I did on the CLI project and move onto Rails!
