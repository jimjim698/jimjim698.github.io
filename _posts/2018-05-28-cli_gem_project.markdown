Building this CLI gem was the most fun and challenging part of this coding journey so far. I'm not going to lie, when I first began I was pretty overwhelmed. Reviewing the requirements made my head start spinning. I understood the material up until this point but by nature my brain likes to think way ahead and this was stressful. I would consider a feature I wanted and while working through it in my head I would think "How the heck am I going to do that?"

Once I focused I decided to just follow the instructions slowly and take it one step at a time. This meant step 1 was to watch the CLI walkthrough that Avi did. This video gave me some peace of mind. Specifically two parts were especially helpful. The first was to just start coding and not second guess myself. All I could do was make progress. This didn't mean everything I was going to write would be part of my final project but by writing code and continuing to move forward, I would gain insight as to what I ultimately wanted this program to look like and also what changes I would need to make to my code to make this possible. 

The second most useful advice this video gave me was to "write the code I wish I had." So after building the initial CLI interface with hardcoded information I decided I wanted to run a different class method based on the users input that would filter which objects would be shown.  Once this was written I knew what I needed the collaborating class to look like.

The most challenging part of this project for me was working in the gemspec folder and publishing my gem to Rubygems.org. This took a lot of patience and researching outside sources.  As a very novice coder I found a lot of resources assumed that some of the smaller steps were obvious and did not explain how to publish the gem all the way through. While this was frustrating at first, it forced me to think and piece a lot of things together. I think the skills I gained just from working through this process are going to be very useful to me as I continue through this course.
