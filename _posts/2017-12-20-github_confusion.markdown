Before beginning this class I had heard of Github and had a rough idea of the concept of it. After finally completing Tic Tac Toe with Procedural and Object Oriented Ruby I'll admit I was a bit excited to give my brain a little rest and learn the ins and outs of Github.  I was sorely mistaken. 
 
By the third lesson in this section my head was spinning. I was having trouble wrapping my head around this Github thing. I knew it was there to make collaborating with other developers easier, but why was it so complicated? One thing that helped a lot was watching the video lectures that were available. Still though, I was confused. 
 
What finally helped it click, and I'm still not 100% there, was when I started the HTML section and began to really use it. With real life application of Github everything slowly began to come together. I was not able to complete the code along video for the Exceptional Realty lessons in one sitting and, knowing I could not save my work using the Learn IDE I had enough sense to push my work up to Github. This was great, however, whenever I tried to pull down my work I was not able to pull down my branches to work on them. Luckily I was able to ask a question and a Flatiron instructor was doing a screenshare with me in a matter of minutes. She quickly resolved my confusion and the last major disconnect I had with Github was bridged. 
 
So what did I learn from all this? A couple things. First, that being discouraged is a waist of time. Sure it's going to happen from time to time but it's important for me to remember that all of these new concepts and processes I'm learning DO make sense, even if I don't understand them immediately. Finally, my big take away from this was that the best way to make sense of anything is to apply it. I can read books on coding all day or every one of the help pages on Github but until I actually play with things and make mistakes I am not truly going to understand them.
