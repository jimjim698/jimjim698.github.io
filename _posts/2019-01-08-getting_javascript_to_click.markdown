All of my projects have ended with a similar but increasing satisfaction, not just with my project, but also with my decision to pursue Web Development as a career. This elation is a side effect of overcoming another state of mind which is a mix of stress and confusion. Before I had gone through this cycle a couple of times, the anxiety was really hard to overcome. Working on a section I did not understand filled me with doubt about my capabilities and potential. Luckily this is no longer the case as I've overcome roadblocks successfully enough times to know IT WILL CLICK! This self knowledge gave me the ability to make a pretty big decision just as I was about to start my Rails with JS project. 

While working through the Tic Tac Toe API lab I was very clearly not getting it. I understood enough that I was making progress and slowly getting through the lab but every step was research either online or going through past labs which I had completed in a similar manner. Javascript, and more specifically AJAX and Jquery were not clicking. Just because I was able to 'trial and error' a function to work did not mean I understood the material. I knew I did not fully grasp the previous lessons and so I was building on a crap foundation that was never going to be sustainable. I knew what I needed to do but I wasn't happy about it.

After some back and forth in my head of how to find another way to do this, I did what I knew needed to be done. I deleted my repository for both the frontend and backend labs for Tic Tac Toe and I went back to the "Using AJAX and Rails" videos and rewatched them. This time I built my own simple rails app to apply the video's information to right away. This alone cleared a lot up for me. The first time around everything was so new I wasn't able to absorb it all but this time I felt way more confident by the end. Next, I needed to go back over the entire "Building APIs" section. These labs I didn't delete, I just went over the lessons and then applied what I needed to the project I used for the video lessons. By the time this was done I knew I was in a way more realistic place of understanding to tackle Tic Tac Toe as well as my project. So that's what I did.  The painfully slow and agonizing process of completing the API frontend was suddenly fun and I knocked it out in a couple of hours.

When all of this was completed I started on my project with confidence. I wasn't able to blindly code this thing together. I still had to research a few things and go over my past notes and labs to get everything working but this time I knew where to look and what was confusing to me. It went from "What does that even mean?" to "How do I set that up correctly?". Two very different frames of mind. I was able to complete every requirement relatively quickly and on one small hold up a fellow student on slack was able to guide me to a solution relatively quickly. Usually completing the project is my big point of validation in a section but this time it was the Tic Tac Toe with API lab that really got me excited and reminded me that I was on the right path for my life.
