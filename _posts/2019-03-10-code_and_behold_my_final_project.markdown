As I wrap up my final project I keep reflecting on the last year and 5 months of learning to code. It took a lot of work to get here, not just in my studies. The reason this typically 6-8 month course took me as long as it did is because when I started I was working 7 days a week and managing a Sober Living House in Salt Lake City. After justifying to my employer, eBay, the benefits for them to pay for this, I needed to start before I was able to adjust my life to take it on. For this reason I was doing my Flatiron work in 1-3 hour bursts whenever I had the chance. Past and present students will understand that this is not a style conducive to success. This was the hand I was dealt though. Luckily, this past summer I was able to move into another Sober Living Management position that allowed me to work two 10 hour shift a week at eBay and really get to it with my coding.  My patience paid off and the struggle from the beginning only made me stronger. 

For my final project I did something similar to my Rails project except with a simpler user interface. It provides the basic information a resident in a sober living  would need on a day to day basis. This includes who is on what chore, who is currently living at the house and an announcements forum to stay up to date on house events from staff. Staff creates an account and only they have access to post announcements and add/edit resident information. 

When I started this I really believed that I understood Redux. I really did! It turns out I was still battling a bit with the complexity so I went through the Redux section again until I was able to build actions and my reducers almost mindlessly. That seems to be a common theme in learning to code. Something seemingly makes little sense and then it clicks. I was told exactly that would happen from a friend when I started. I joke that it's my happy place. When I'm learning the material I need complete focus but once that click happens I can turn on a football game and just go at it. That's how I spent a lot of Sundays this past NFL season. 

The most difficult part of this project was the transition from "Here is how you do this, now do it" to "You know how to figure this out, now figure it out." For example, there is no section on learn for how to set-up your Rails API. They provide a blog post that walks you through the basic process but just reading this wasn't enough. It wasn't a breakdown of modules like the rest of the curriculum. I had to reach out to other sources online to really understand it and figure it out. While this was frustrating, I knew it was good for me to practice doing. I'm sure Avi won't be sending me a video walkthrough of my first assignment when I enter the workforce. This was also true for handling sessions in React. I met with a technical coach but the whole 30 minutes was basically just getting rid of code from my failed attempts and I ultimately had to figure this out on my own. I did figure it out though.

As my time at Flatiron in winding down I know I still have a lot to learn about web development but I feel prepared to learn and grow in this field. I think the frustrations I faced on this final project gave me some of the most important skills of all and I am excited to take my next steps into the world of coding.
